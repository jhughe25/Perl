Perl Coding Samples

Initial Note 1/9/19: The Perl coding samples here are a product of two separate classes: BIFS 617 and BIFS 619. BIFS 617 was the primary course for learning Perl, and contains the most files as a result. This consists of all of the questions for the final as outlined in the Final Exam word document, a standalone script for parsing files in FASTA format, and the final project for the course. The final project was supposed to be a group project, but the other two members of my group contributed very little. As a result, the final product is not as concise or error-free as it should be. 

BIFS 619 involved a group project where we were tasked with creating a pipeline to automate the parsing of data. Details of this project are outlined in the BIFS 619 syllabus. The BIFS 619 script takes in any number of accession numbers from NCBI's SRA database as command line arguments in a Linux environment. It requires FASTQ Dump, TopHat2 and Cufflinks to be installed, and prints out status updates as each step is completed. The program then automatically performs a FASTQ dump of those accession numbers, which creates two separate files due to split reads. It then takes those two files and aligns them using TopHat2, then submits the alignment into Cufflinks for further analysis. The samples we chose for analysis were both cancerous and non-cancerous tissue samples taken from the same individual for differential expression analysis.
