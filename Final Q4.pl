#Final Exam Question 4

#Write a Perl program that adds up the numbers in a file and prints out their sum, average, max and min.  Assume that there is one number per line.  
#Print the average out showing two digits after the decimal point (Hint: look up the printf command). 

#Test your program with a file containing:
#40
#10
#2
#3
#4

#Your output should look like:
#sum = 59
#ave = 11.80
#max = 40
#min = 2

#Your code should work on any file containing different or more numbers than listed above (i.e. donâ€™t just assume you have 5 numbers in a file).
